<h1>『How to dispose of a body』</h1>

<h2> S T E P S </h2>

<h4> First</h4>
<p> 
You'll need to cut the body into pieces. Best to chop the limbs, the body, and the head into different parts. I suggest splitting the legs in half at the knees, since it makes it easier to put away. Remember to cut at the joint, where the connetion between bones are the weakest.

<h4> Second</h4>
<p> 
Second, grab a few garbage bags, and put two limbs in each bag. Remember to stuff it as to not raise any suspicion. The body goes in one seperate bag.

<h4> What you should have:</h4>

<h4> Third</h4>
<p>
You could have 2 ways to dispose of the body:
<p> 
    <ul>
        1.Just throw them away like normal garbage! And to not arouse suspicion, act normal, and make sure to throw it in someone else's trash dump far away from your house, so if the body gets traced back to the original can, you won't get any suspicion! (I recommend learning about <a href="https://www.aftermath.com/content/human-decomposition/">body decomposition</a> to help know how to properly cover up the body.)
    
    </ul>
    <ul>
        2.You could burn the body. Although this way is very effective, it's harmful for the envrionment and creates alot of suspicious vibes.
    
    </ul>
<h4> Aaaand...</h4>
<p> 
That's it! You've succesfully got away with your murder! And make sure to remember about the other evidence! And wear those gloves!
